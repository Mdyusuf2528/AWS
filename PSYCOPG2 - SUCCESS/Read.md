Most of us known the concept & advantages of AWS-LAMBDA,

But It doesn't have all python modules as prebuild so, we have to import that layers what we need

It is here, Most of us failure
So that I found some way for that

That is:

1) Using cloud9 -> to create a cloud9 IDE with amazon-linux environment with default settings
2) To write the command promt code for py3.8 installation (Here, I take py3.8), pip, & our need py module (Here, I want psycopg2)
3) Here, I just give the commands with the file name of ("Python layer imort method - ex - psycopg2")
4) Then You can directly create the layer through cmd
